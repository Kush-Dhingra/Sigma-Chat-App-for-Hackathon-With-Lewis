  <h2>Theme: "Functionally Dysfunctional"</h2>
  <p>Sigma Chat was built for a hackathon by <a href="https://github.com/elebumm" target="_blank">Lewis Menelaws</a> the theme "Functionally Dysfunctional." While the app functions like a regular chat app, the "dysfunctional" part comes in with My unique spin on language. The app is designed to be fun and slightly chaotic, embracing the quirkiness of Gen-Z slang while still keeping the core functionality of a chat platform intact.</p>
